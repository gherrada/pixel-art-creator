# PixelArtCreator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.5.


It's a simple way to draw pixel art. 

The main features are: 

1. You can draw on click. 

2. You can select a color.

3. You can choose to draw or erase a cell of the grid by clicking the pen or eraser tool. 

4. You can start over by clicking new to clean the whole canvas. 

5. You can save your image at any point as a png file. 


Characteristics of the image

Right now it keeps a transparent background.  So unless you paint parts of the background with white,
the png will only show what you draw.

Future features

It would be nice to change the canvas size.  Right now it makes an 11 x 11 grid, with 40 by 40 pixels. 
Could either add it to controls as an input, or make a modal pop up for it. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
